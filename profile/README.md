Welcome to Miro's Github Page! Here at Miro, we aim to bring teams closer, to be more connected, and to build better products, together. Miro empowers remote, in-office, and hybrid teams to communicate and collaborate across formats, tools, channels, and timezones — without the constraints of physical location, meeting space, and whiteboards.
